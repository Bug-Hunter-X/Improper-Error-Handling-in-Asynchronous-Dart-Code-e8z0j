# Improper Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: insufficient error handling during network requests or other asynchronous operations.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the flawed code with a missing error recovery strategy.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with more resilient error handling.

## Problem

The original code uses a `try-catch` block to catch exceptions during an HTTP request. However, upon encountering an error, it simply prints the error message and continues, leaving the calling code unaware of the failure.  In a production application, this lack of robust error handling can have severe consequences.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates improved error handling techniques:

1. **Explicit error handling:** The solution clearly handles exceptions, providing informative error messages and potentially taking corrective actions.
2. **Returning meaningful results:** Instead of merely printing errors, the improved version provides a way to convey the error to the calling function.  The `Future` can either complete successfully with the data or fail with an appropriate exception.

This revised approach enhances reliability and allows for better error management in the application.
